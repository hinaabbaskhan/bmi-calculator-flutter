# bmi_calculator



### Our Objective

The goal of this project is to explore the customization of Flutter Widgets to bring our unique and beautiful user interface designs to life. 

### What you will create

Weâ€™re going to build a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
